### SQL injection vulnerability exists in Sourcecodester Simple Inventory System

official website:https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/4481/simple-inventory-system-using-phpmysql.html

version:v1.0

routeï¼šlogin.php

injection parameter:$_POST['username']

#### 1.Vulnerability analysis

As shown in the figure below, in login.php, after the username parameter is passed in through post, it is directly spliced into the SQL query statement without any security filtering, thus leading to the occurrence of SQL injection vulnerabilities. We can inject query statements through universal passwords to log in to the backend without the need for an admin password.
